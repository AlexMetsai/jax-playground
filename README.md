As the name suggests, this is a playground repository for developing deep learning algorithms with Jax. If you peak into the code, keep in mind that any approaches should not be taken as guidelines. On the contrary, these implementions most probably contain anti-patterns. Breaking the rules and making mistakes is one of the best ways to learn, but this doesn't mean that you should be following these mistakes like you would read a tutorial or documentation.

Right now I'm focusing on low level details for educationary reasons, there are plenty of higher level libraries for deep learning that use Jax as the backed, like Haiku and Flax.

As knowledge accumulates, I'll try to follow best practices for Jax and improve any implemented algorithms, but since this is not guaranteed for the moment, tread with caution if you want to adopt any of this code in your projects.
